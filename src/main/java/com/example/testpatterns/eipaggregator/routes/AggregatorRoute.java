 * Sample aggregator route definition.

 * It consumes messages out of the <i>direct:entry</i> entry point and forwards them to <i>direct:endpoint</i>.
 * Route accepts messages containing String as a body, it aggregates the messages based on the settings and forwards
 * them as CSV to the output chanel.
 *
 * Settings for the aggregation are: aggregate until 3 messages are bundled or wait 2000ms before sending bundled
 * messages further.
 * </p>
 *
 * In this example input/output endpoints names are stored in <i>application.properties</i> FileNIO.
